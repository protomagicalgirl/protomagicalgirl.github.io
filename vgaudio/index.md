## The Video Game Audio Project

### An introduction:

This project started with a paper we wrote for a college class entitled *Nintendium Philharmonic: The History of the Sound of Nintendo Gaming Consoles From the Famicom to the Wii*. What started as just a research report, however, is slowly evolving into something bigger. As we were doing our research for the project, we struggled to find any good sources of information that both have a lot of information and present that information at a level that is both detailed and accessible. Most of the information we encountered came from scattered documents, forum posts, or emulator references, and was either a Wikipedia-level summary or a full ROM map of the audio with little explanation.

Someone had to change this. Why not us?

As far as we can tell, the paper we wrote is the single most complete and accessible document on the history of the technologies employed to produce audio by Nintendo's consoles. However, it was written in the style of an academic paper. No one likes academic papers. Not even us. It also requires a fair amount of knowledge about audio and programming concepts just to parse.

We'd like to do this better. Thus, our new project was born: A series of articles written for a regular human audience, each covering one console or necessary background knowledge on audio production techniques.

That'll get started soon, hopefully!
